# Dimitris Giannopoulos - Coding Challenge Notes

## Docker
* The image used can be improved, however, I ran into problems with the nginx repository when using another image, so I kept the old one.

## Kubernetes
* I used a Kubernetes environment provided by docker-desktop on Windows for deployment validation.
* In order to deploy the app to K8s I need to push the built image to an image registry (I will use my dockerhub registry - dimitrisgian/parkos)
